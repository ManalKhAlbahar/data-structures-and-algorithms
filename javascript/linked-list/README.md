# Single Linked list
Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go 
in one direction. There is a single track that we can traverse the list in; we start at the head 
node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.

# Challenge
to string
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

# Approach & Efficiency
Insert function for the linked list was created with O(1) time .

# API
Linked List methods: insert, includes, toString
