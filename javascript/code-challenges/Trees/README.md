# Trees
- The tree is one of the most common data structures in computer science and the natural way to model certain subject areas. 

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
- Create a Binary Tree class Define a method for each of the depth first traversals: pre order,in orderand post order which 
returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
- Create a Binary Search Tree class, with the following additional methods: Add Adds a new node with that value in the correct 
location in the binary search tree, Contains :Returns boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
- BinaryTree: preOrder(), inOrder(), postOrder().
- BST : add(value), contains(value) .
## API
- npm test to test the files (binarySearchTree.test.js , and binaryTree.test.js ).
